  title: Analytics by Design
  desc: Analytics-readiness is something that all projects should have on Day 1 of its launch. The key to that is to avoid analytics debt. The data collected from policy implementations, or programme executions should address questions that will help finetune refinements down the road. The data generated from products and platforms should help inform how well it is working, and what new features to build, or what to tweak. But this is often not the reality. Many projects face challenges with analytics downstream, potentially leading to disappointments from both from the business side, as well as the data science practitioners. In this sharing, the speaker will share more about Analytics By Design, which is a methodology that GovTech had mooted, and is piloting internally.

  title: Towards a comparable metric for AI model interpretability in Computer Vision
  desc: The Video Analytics (VA) team builds deep learning models to address specific public sector use cases. As Deep Learning models become more advanced with increasing complexity, the need for model interpretability has come into greater focus. Understanding features that contribute to a Deep Learning model's output helps AI Engineers design better models and troubleshooting. There are methods known today to help with Deep Learning model interpretability, such as those requiring visual explanations on local prediction instances. But we aspire to create a global metric to quantify explainability. Find out how we are doing this in our collaboration with Meta/PyTorch.
