  title: Embracing a Brave New World of Technology – A Government Journey
  desc: Many large organizations are quickly overtaken by the rapid progress of technology around them and for governments around the world, this is no exception. Venturing into the brave new world of technology is like a young person leaving home for the first time. It is full of freedom, excitement and anxiety, It is also full of risks, fear and uncertainties. Ignoring technology like Cloud, SaaS, full stack, etc., is no more an option. The days of building bespoke monolithic systems from scratch is risky, costly and wasteful. The new world is about reusability, iterations and automation. It’s about talent, culture and design. The Singapore Government, like everyone else, needs to embrace this brave new world or risk becoming irrelevant.

  title: Extending the AWS Cloud Outside of Public Regions
  desc: The AWS Nitro System is the underlying platform for our next generation of EC2 instances that enables AWS to innovate faster, further reduce cost for our customers, and deliver added benefits like increased security and new instance types. AWS has completely re-imagined our virtualisation infrastructure. Traditionally, hypervisors protect the physical hardware and bios, virtualise the CPU, storage, networking, and provide a rich set of management capabilities. With the Nitro System, we are able to break apart those functions, offload them to dedicated hardware and software, and reduce costs by delivering practically all of the resources of a server to your instances. In this talk, we will explore the improved hardware-based security in the Nitro System, including how we can leverage this technology outside of traditional public cloud regions using AWS Outposts and Local Zones.

  title: Changed Responsibilities in Modern Software Development Environments
  desc: "With business increasing the pressure and demand for flexibility of the development team, the agile movement was pushed to the limits. CI/CD was born to reduce manual steps to reduce human errors and increase speed to go-live! With DevOps, the teams also took on application responsibilities, from cradle to grave. Nevertheless, software security is still missing in many full-stack developers' resumes and application security responsibilities are still pushed off to the security department. A real pity, because the agile, CI/CD and DevOps are security-enabling practices. This session explains Shift-left, early security enablement in the development Lifecycle. As the application development becomes more developer centric, the developer’s toolset must match the new challenges to have responsibilities matching capabilities. Learn from rugged software to supply chain cleanliness. Learn to avoid the common pitfalls and benefits of modern application development strategies. Hear why security champions programmes tend to fail, compliance driven security training is a waste of time and money. Security teams struggle and fail to integrate security tooling in release pipelines. Take back the best practices, proven solutions and Shift Left beyond the development. Who should attend: Dev Teams, Appsec, Security Specialists."

  title: Simplifying Data and AI with Lakehouse Platforms
  desc: "Traditionally, building data and AI applications in most enterprises has been complex because data is stored and processed across many disparate systems: data lakes such as Amazon S3, SQL data warehouses, message bus systems, and others. Enterprises have to staff large data engineering projects to move data across these systems, and end-users experience long delays and reliability problems. In the past few years, the cloud and open source have enabled a new class of data platform that unifies data lakes and warehouses, the lakehouse, and makes it significantly easier to share data across an organisation for all use cases. Because these platforms use open source formats, they are also directly usable in AI and streaming applications. I will describe how lakehouse systems such as the open source Delta Lake project, and how Databricks customers are using the lakehouse to achieve unprecedented scale and operational simplicity across analytics and AI use cases."

  title: Navigating Cybersecurity in the Digital Darkness
  desc: "As the Singapore government embarks on a massive digitalisation journey, there is also an increasing awareness about the importance of cybersecurity - the foundation of digital trust for our government's services. With awareness of it growing, cybersecurity has been said to be one of the biggest reasons why digitalisation is getting more expensive. This prompted me to investigate further to understand why. When we dove deeper, I came to realise that the biggest problem is that everyone wants to provide a solution even when we are not sure what the problem really is. It is akin to navigating cybersecurity in the digital darkness. By the end of this presentation, I hope to empower attendees on how to identify and avoid artificial constraints, think more critically about cybersecurity threats, and implement simpler systems and operations for better security performance. Who should attend: CIOs, CISOs, Product Owners, Cybersecurity Auditors, and Cybersecurity Consultants."
