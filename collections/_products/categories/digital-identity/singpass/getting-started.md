To integrate Singpass’ APIs into your digital services, you may refer to the steps below.

**1. Select your desired API from the Singpass API library**

Browse through Singpass’ extensive [API library](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/developers){:target="_blank"} to identify the relevant API for your digital service and read through the principles and guidelines of the selected API. Tutorials are also available in the API library to guide you through the testing and deploying the API, without the need to login.
 
**2. Submit your linkup request**

Begin designing the user journey for your digital service with the principles and guidelines for the API in mind. You may also ride on the user journey templates provided or reference sample user journeys.

Submit a linkup request once your user journey is completed through this [link](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/cplogin){:target="_blank"}.

**3. Deploy your application**

Once your linkup request is approved, an App ID will be generated. This App configuration (i.e.X.509 public keys, JWKS endpoint, callbacks URLs, etc.) can then be used to deploy your application.

Please accept the Services Agreement and Subscription for relevant services before submitting your configuration.
