### Overview

StackOps was conceptualised to enable agencies to embrace Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), which emphasises automated monitoring and logging of services. SRE also shifts monitoring and logging processes into the development cycle itself to ensure that operational concerns reliability concepts are build-in.

StackOps is part of the Monitoring component of the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html){:target="_blank"}, which are tools to help you track application performance and provide you with operational transparency for effective incident response.

### What is StackOps?

StackOps is a Monitoring toolchain that focuses on the most important and critical user actions of your service. It features automated reactions based on the golden monitoring and logging metrics such as latency, load, limit, and errors.

StackOps consists of **StackOps Logging**, a suite of centrally managed logging applications such as Elastic, Logstash, and Kibana that transforms and visualises your data from multiple sources.

### Why Should StackOps be Adopted?

Adopting StackOps can benefit users in the following ways:
-	User can start monitoring and logging their systems quickly and simply.
-	Creation of meaningful presentation of metrics that are aggregated based on what service owner, administrators, and customers need to know.
-	Fills current lack of monitoring and logging solutions that are quick and easy to set up.
-	Resolves problem of inability to track System Level Objectives (SLOs) of Whole-of Government (WOG) products and services.
-	Offers a one-stop-shop for monitoring the health of government services.
