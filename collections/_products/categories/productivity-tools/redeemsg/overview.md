RedeemSG is a national voucher system developed by GovTech’s Open Government Products (OGP) team. It digitalises, simplifies and enhances the user experience for public agencies, participating merchants and recipients in each Government voucher campaign. RedeemSG provides a digital solution that solves the inefficiencies and costs involved in paper voucher schemes.

### Key Features

RedeemSG has three components:

- Admin portal for agencies
- RedeemSG Merchant app
- Resident vouchers 

### Benefits

For Recipients:
- Recipients can sign up and claim vouchers without needing to download a mobile app.

For Merchants:
- Merchants can accept vouchers easily using the RedeemSG Merchant app, which easily tracks transactions and payouts, removing the need to count vouchers manually.
- Merchants are reimbursed the next day instead of waiting for weeks or even months

For Public Agencies:
- Agencies can efficiently manage voucher campaigns and track redemptions using the RedeemSG admin portal

### Use Case

RedeemSG has a pipeline of voucher campaigns worth more than $850 million, and has enabled over 27 million redemptions since April 2020 across 10 national campaigns. Most recently, the solution was used for the launch of the nationwide CDC Voucher Scheme for Singaporean households.      

More than 1.1 million households (over 91%) in Singapore have claimed their vouchers, spending more than S$ 148 million in total for both the 2021 and 2022 CDC Voucher Schemes. More than 17,500 merchants are onboard the RedeemSG system to accept vouchers. An earlier version of RedeemSG was used to track the distribution of items including masks, SG Together packs and meals. It was also integrated with 1,100 vending machines and supported the work of 14,000 staff and volunteers.

The RedeemSG team will continue to build a platform that is able to cater to a wider range of voucher campaigns across government agencies and charities. The team envisions that this would eventually allow agencies to vastly trim the time it takes to launch a social assistance scheme or engagement initiative.
