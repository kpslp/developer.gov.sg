Public agencies can enhance citizen engagement efforts with [CrowdTaskSG](https://www.crowdtask.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} - a Whole-of-Government (WOG) Citizen Engagement Tool that is designed for task creation, distribution, engagement and analysis.

Created by GovTech, CrowdTaskSG is a digital platform with a web portal that lets agencies engage communities of citizens to participate in crowdsourcing activities and tasks – such as surveys, polls, translation work and more.

CrowdTaskSG seeks to encourage more individuals to voluntarily step forward to actively support the process of creating a better place. It offers various opportunities for citizens to share their opinions and feedback with government agencies. 

Working with interested citizens helps government agencies to improve their services and products, for example, by tapping on citizens  expertise to solve problems and involving the public early in product or policy creation, while enriching the experience of citizens as they contribute by carrying out the tasks and activities.

The use of [MyInfo](products/categories/digital-identity/myinfo/){:target="_blank"} for citizens allows for personalised tasks. For example, agencies can opt to select parents for surveys related to childcare or early childhood education.

Through gamification and incentivisation, CrowdTaskSG will keep citizens engaged through the whole journey to build high-quality responses.
