1. Log into the [CrowdTaskSG Agency](https://www.crowdtask.gov.sg/agency){:target="_blank"} page and create a public task. 
2. This task will be distributed on the CrowdTaskSG web portal to the community of interested citizens, depending on the criteria you have chosen to apply. 
3. The selected citizens will be engaged through gamification and incentivisation during the campaign duration.
4. You can analyse the results after the campaign has concluded by using the CrowdTaskSG data visualisation tool. This makes reporting much easier with ready graphs and charts.
