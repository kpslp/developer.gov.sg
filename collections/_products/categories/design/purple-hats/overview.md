Purple HATS is a customizable, automated web accessibility testing tool that allows software development teams to find and fix accessibility problems to improve the access of persons with disabilities (PWDs) to digital services.

Developed by the Accessibility (A11Y) team in GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS), Purple HATS is an open-source tool  that  developers to build more inclusive products during the product development process.  It helps product development teams rapidly scan and check for potential accessibility issues from their development machines or within their Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with very basic command-line knowledge.

Purple HATS includes a bot that scans through and analyses web pages for accessibility issues. For example, the bot will check:

- Whether buttons are labelled and how they are read by assistive technology, such as screen readers. For example, if the ‘Submit’ button on a webpage is read out only as ‘Button’, a PWD will find it difficult to determine what specific action the button actually performs.
- Whether pictures or images are labelled correctly with alternate text (alt text) provided. Otherwise, the unlabeled images will be flagged as an accessibility issue, as blind or visually impaired users might have difficulty understanding the content of the images.

The bot then provides the impact of the accessibility issues by mapping them against the axe-core library of Deque System, a company that provides digital accessibility audits and software tools. Deque’s AXE accessibility testing engine is used to test the accessibility of websites and other HTML-based user interfaces.

The results of Purple HATS’s scans are then compiled in JSON format, and an HTML report is generated, providing users flexibility as to how they review accessibility findings.
