TradeTrust is a framework that comprises <b>globally accepted standards</b> connecting governments and businesses to a <b>public blockchain</b>. This enables <b>trusted interoperability</b> of electronic trade documents across <b>digital platforms</b>. Thus, TradeTrust is offered as a <b>digital utility</b>. TradeTrust has proven capability in tracing the source of digitally issued documents and verifying their integrity independently. Examples of use cases include validating the authenticity and provenance of government-issued documents, title transfers of electronic Billing of Lading and more. 

On 31 Mar 2020, a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) was executed by the [Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/){:target="\_blank"}, the [Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home){:target="\_blank"} and the [Port of Rotterdam (PoR)](https://www.portofrotterdam.com/en){:target="\_blank"}. Through which simulated transactions for electronic bill of ladings (eBLs) were successfully conducted between Rotterdam and Singapore. 
The next phase of TradeTrust’s development will explore the use of a sidechain to further improve cost and transactional efficiencies.

Yet another trial was concluded on 18 August 2021 in which the [Australian Border Force]( https://www.abf.gov.au/){:target="\_blank"} (ABF), the  Infocomm Media  Development  Authority of Singapore (IMDA),  and [Singapore  Customs](https://www.customs.gov.sg/){:target="\_blank"},  along  with  industry  participants,  successfully  proved  trade  documents  can  be  issued  and  verified digitally across two independent systems, reducing cross-border transaction costs. This demonstrated TradeTrust’s value as a framework to connect governments and businesses for more effective trade flow.

Verifiable credentials and decentralised identifiers (DID) such as TradeTrust represent key opportunities for government authorities as trust anchors and businesses to accelerate digitalisation and build trust through digital proofs.
