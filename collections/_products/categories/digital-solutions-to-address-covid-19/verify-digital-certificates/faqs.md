  - name: Why is verify.gov.sg leveraging blockchain technology?
    description: >
      Using blockchain, we can greatly reduce the barrier of entry to publishing protected documents in a secure format, instead of using existing proprietary software that is costly. In addition, a public blockchain is owned and maintained by the community and is easily accessible by anyone. As a result, there is no need to run or maintain services to verify documents.
