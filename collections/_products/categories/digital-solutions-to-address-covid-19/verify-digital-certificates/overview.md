Verify (Digital Certificates) is the Singapore Government's platform to conveniently and securely authenticate and validate .OA (OpenAttestation) format documents that have been issued by government entities.
	
(OpenAttestation is an open-source framework for verifiable document and transferable records.)                             

Verify is built upon the public blockchain to reduce entry barriers to publishing protected documents in a secure format instead of costly proprietary software. As a result, agencies do not need to run or maintain services to verify documents.

A user with an .OA digital certificate may simply scan the QR code provided or click on the link to be brought to the verification page before the content is displayed.

Relevant authorities such as immigration offficers and employers can visit <https://www.verify.gov.sg> to start the process of verifying digital documents that can include travel documentation and health certificates.
