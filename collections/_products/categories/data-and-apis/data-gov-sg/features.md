### Curated dashboards for quick reference

The homepage and nine topic pages feature dashboards with charts that are topical and relevant to the public. For example, the dashboard in the Economy section shows key economic indicators such as GDP, Consumer Price Index, and Business Expectations.
Another example: when the haze affected Singapore previously, the home page and Environment page were updated to show charts on PM2.5 concentration and PSI readings. 

### Data visualizations 

Data visualisations to show key trends for each dataset. These can be embedded and downloaded for reuse. Users can preview the contents of each dataset without downloading them. 
For example, users can compare the total final energy consumption between households and industry by checking out the Energy Market Authority’s [“Total Final Energy Consumption” dataset page](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/total-final-energy-consumption-2018){:target="_blank"}.
Users can also easily embed data.gov.sg charts on their own websites using the “embed” feature.

### High-quality data

The development team works closely with all government agencies to improve the quality of data on the portal by standardizing formats, ensuring machine-readability and improving documentation.
This ensures that data users can easily analyze, mash up and visualise datasets from data.gov.sg without spending time unnecessarily on data munging. Automatic data standard validation ensures that the datasets are usable and interoperable.

### Quick access to open data APIs from multiple agencies

 Users can tap on the Data.gov.sg Developer Portal to retrieve high-frequency data from multiple agencies easily. With a single application programming interface (API) key, developers and analysts can access government open data APIs from different public agencies via the portal, instead of signing up with each individual agency.
 
### Data blog with best practices

The Data.gov.sg blog section aims to illustrate social trends and explain government policies through articles using data analysis and visualizations. These data stories show how data can be used for deeper analysis and creative visualizations.
