APEX Cloud is a centralised data sharing portal for government agencies. It is an enhanced iteration of APEX on prem and is hosted on the [Government on Commercial Cloud](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud/overview.html){:target="_blank"} to increase its scalability and the number of features/capabilities it can offer. This is in response to the growing need to effectively manage a growing quantity and complexity of APIs as APIs continue to grow in importance in driving the digital economy, business efficiencies and in facilitating data exchange, opening up collaboration opportunities, and innovation across the government. 

APEX Cloud is currently in the pilot phase and will reach the General Availability (GA) phase in March/April 2023. Full migration of the workload from [Apex on prem](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/data-and-apis/apex/overview.html){:target="_blank"} to APEX Cloud will be completed in Q1 of FY23, after which APEX on prem will be decommissioned.
