APEX Cloud is a centralised data sharing portal for government agencies. It is an enhanced iteration of APEX on prem and is hosted on the [Government on Commercial Cloud](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud/overview.html){:target="_blank"} to increase its scalability and the number of features/capabilities it can offer. This is in response to the growing need to effectively manage a growing quantity and complexity of APIs as APIs continue to grow in importance in driving the digital economy, business efficiencies and in facilitating data exchange, opening up collaboration opportunities, and innovation across the government. 

APEX Cloud is currently in the pilot phase and will reach the General Availability (GA) phase in March/April 2023. Full migration of the workload from [Apex on prem](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/data-and-apis/apex/overview.html){:target="_blank"} to APEX Cloud will be completed in Q1 of FY23, after which APEX on prem will be decommissioned in Q2 of FY23.

### Use Cases

APEX Cloud is currently used to provide secured data exchanges for the digital registration of births via the [LifeSG](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/platform/lifesg/overview.html){:target="_blank"} app. Upon successful registration, users will be alerted to download their child’s digital birth certificate from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority's (ICA) website. This can be done through the electronic retrieval of the birth certificate which can be instantly verified via the e-service.

APEX Cloud also allows automatic registration of deaths with ICA. Once a death is registered, a digital death certificate will be generated by the system, and the medical practitioner or a hospital staff will provide the next-of-kin with with information such as the digital death certificate number, to allow them to download the certificate from ICA's [My Legacy portal](https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}. 

This has streamlined the birth and death registration process to ease administrative burdens for parents and a deceased's next-of-kin(s).
