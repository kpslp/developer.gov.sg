### API catalogue
In addition to secure data sharing, APEX Cloud’s API catalogue allows government agencies to effectively search for relevant APIs across the government. This promotes knowledge sharing within the government, while reducing digital silos and the duplication of efforts. Rapid development is also possible without affecting backend systems through the API catalogue. Agencies can now discover and reuse existing APIs in their tech stack. This reduces an agency’s development, integration and troubleshooting timespan, thereby speeding up service delivery.

### Central logging system 
The central logging system of APEX provides an overview of all API call logs which allows agencies to troubleshoot issues when necessary. This will be a central point for agencies to manage, monitor and harden security for APIs where necessary.

### Central administration dashboard 
This is a monitoring tool for system health checks and analytics. Government agencies can garner an overview of the popularity and usage of their shared datasets, which allows constant improvement of datasets according to popularity and demand. Less popular data sets can also be deprioritised to allow for more time and resources to be allocated to impactful datasets that will be more beneficial for inter-agency sharing and use.

### Self-service model 
APEX’s self-service model allows the requesting agency to pull data sets from various agencies directly due to pre-configured access controls set by the data source agency. This facilitates the data sharing process as it eliminates the need to submit a request and await approval from the data source agency.

### Provision of professional services

### Ability to support multi-tenanted Environments and modern RESTful and SOAP APIs.
