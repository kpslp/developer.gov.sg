The award-winning Open Digital Platform (ODP) is a key component in the digital infrastructure underpinning Singapore’s Smart Nation ambitions.

ODP is a joint development between GovTech and JTC, and will power JTC’s Punggol Digital District (PDD) when it open progressively from 2024.

Built on the [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html){:target="_blank"}, the ODP is designed to integrate various smart city solutions including:

- facilities, building and estate management systems
- district cooling system
- pneumatic waste conveyancing system
- autonomous goods delivery systems
- access and security systems
- carpark systems
- traffic lights systems
- autonomous vehicles in PDD.


The ODP is envisaged as the bedrock of day-to-day life in our Smart Nation, centralising various smart city solutions in a single district management system. It will facilitate the digitalisation and centralisation of district operations to:

  1. Empower estate managers to run and operate estates effectively and efficiently.
  2. Enable the district to meet sustainability targets for water and energy consumption, and manpower optimisation.
  3. Enable the seamless delivery of estate services and amenities through open and secure data sharing frameworks.


The ODP will be a key enabler in delivering seamless convenience for citizens, businesses and other government services. With real-time access to information – from sensors and IoT devices – on what is happening around the district, and with the help of predictive analytics, estate managers can quickly identify and react to potential problems on the ground.
