### Launching the Singapore Government Developer Portal

In early 2020, we began work on the Singapore Government Developer Portal, a site originally meant to serve the 
[Government Digital Services](https://hive.tech.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} team in GovTech. As it happens, there is a vast catalogue of Government digital 
products and services and, at the time, we realised that many teams across the public sector just didn’t know enough about each others’ services to leverage them. 
This was a problem because the solutions that many teams needed had already been developed, but simply remained undiscovered by them!

By gathering the product information and documentation about all these services and placing them in one central, convenient portal, we hoped to break down information 
barriers and generate a greater synergy across the public sector. We are lucky to have the support of our senior leadership CE Ping Soon and 
GCDTO Cheow Hoe in driving adoption of the developer portal and setting the directive for the consolidation of product information within GovTech.

As we continued to work on the developer portal to fulfil our original vision, it also became clear that it was now the logical channel through which we 
could engage the burgeoning government, vendor, and tech community. After all, our community building efforts were driven by the same underlying desire to break down information 
barriers - especially barriers to government products and services - as well as to create a space for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### A One-Stop Resource Hub for Government Digital Products and Services

Today, the developer portal is the one-stop resource hub for government digital products and services. Our homepage have been redesigned to reflect this vision, with an emphasis on our brand colours, and intuitive icons and features to improve our visitor experience. Governments, vendors and, tech community members can view Whole of Government products, access useful guidelines, follow standards and best practices to achieve consistency across a wide range of Government products, discover community spaces and, source for technical documentation through our documentation service, which can be accessed through this [link](https://docs.developer.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}.

We have published information and technical documentations for over 120 products and are continuing to publish more, such as information on the 
[Singapore Government Tech Stack](/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/){:target="_blank"} (SGTS) - a common platform that streamlines and simplifies the development process for government agencies. With SGTS, agencies will be able to utilise a suite of tools and services hosted on a common infrastructure to ensure consistency and high quality in their applications. Through the publication of our SGTS interactive map, our visitors can now view all SGTS products in a single diagram and easily click on individual product names to access full product pages for more information! Another popular content request from our partners is the Instruction Manual for Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems (ICT&SS) Management (previously known as "IM8"), which we are proud to say is also available on the [developer portal](/guidelines/standards-and-best-practices/im8){:target="_blank"}.

Given the growing repository of product information in the developer portal, the "All Products" page was launched to provide audiences with a single view of all products within the developer portal. Collections and categories for our products were also established to help our visitors navigate the developer portal in a seamless and intuitive manner. Examples of some of our collections include: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Citizen-Facing products, SGTS and, What's New. 

To engage the community, we introduced a [community tab](/communities){:target="_blank"} that provides information about our 
[open-sourced technologies](/communities/open-source-technologies){:target="_blank"}, [STACK-X meetup](/communities/stack-x-meetups/overview.html){:target="_blank"}, [past webinar recordings](/communities/stack-x-meetups/past-webinars/){:target="_blank"} and [developer blogs](/communities/developer-blogs/){:target="_blank"}.

Our [Documentation Service](https://docs.developer.gov.sg){:target="_blank"} service also allows product teams to share and contribute their technical content such as API specifications, user and onboarding guides, and product roadmaps. You can visit the Documentation Service if you are looking to integrate with government digital services and need information to help you get started. Technical contents are already available in the Documentation Service. We have also enchanced the layout and design of our documentation service to include a central query bar and an overview of all documentation categories to allow our visitors to easily source for relevant documentations. We aim to consistently update and provide new technical content at regular intervals so... please visit this page regularly for our updates!
