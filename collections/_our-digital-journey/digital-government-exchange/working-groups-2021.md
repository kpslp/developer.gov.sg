### Overview

The 2021 Working Groups (WGs) saw representatives share experiences and opportunities on topics covering the Cloud, Digital identity, Data governance, and Digital maturity.

* **The cloud WG** dwelled on the momentous shift in the delivery of private/public information systems, where a new service delivery model provides benefits including agility and velocity, innovation, digital transformation, scalability, resiliency, cost-savings, data security, and transparency. Policy approaches and technology strategies were shared on risk management with cloud adoption.

* **The data governance WG** focused on key trends in data governance policies, data governance regulations, and data organisational structures in supporting member countries’ broader big data ambitions. The WG also produced valuable insights on data stewardship and how process, people, and technology are key enablers of data governance.

* **The digital identity WG** produced insights on how countries utilise digital identity and models that might enable mutual recognition and/or interoperability. Given the pandemic, information was shared openly on respective governments’ experiences with leveraging digital ID for appropriate COVID-19 responses.

* **The digital maturity WG** developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) framework for understanding different levels of digital maturity and conducted research interviews with member countries to validate the 7 elements of digital maturity in reimagining and redesigning governments’ digital estate. These elements are user-centred design, culture of digital by design, data-driven approach, appropriate technology and infrastructure, senior leadership buy-in and appropriate governance, appropriate institutional funding and capacity, and digital capability.

Given the COVID-19 pandemic, a special edition of the Digital Government Exchange Safe Travel WG was convened in 2021. Digital governments and smart cities discussed safe travel solutions such as the generation of digital health certificates, cross-border verification, and open-sourced technical specifications or frameworks. These insights have been published on the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) Public Institutions [blog](https://publicadministration.un.org/en/Home/Blog){:target="_blank"}.
